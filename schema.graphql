  # the StakingRewards contract mutually exclusively, so for indexing them in the subgraph, we
  # can combine both of them into the same category.
  SENIOR_POOL_UNSTAKE
  # NOTE: We do not define a `SENIOR_POOL_UNSTAKE_MULTIPLE` transaction category for two reasons:
  # (1) `Unstaked` and `UnstakedMultiple` events are not emitted mutually exclusively by the StakingRewards
  # contract; on the contrary, for every `UnstakedMultiple` event, a corresponding set of `Unstaked`
  # events are emitted whose params collectively comprise the same data as the `UnstakedMultiple` event.
  # So we don't need to index `UnstakedMultiple` events for the sake of obtaining any unique data. And
  # doing so would only create a need for the consumer of the subgraph to de-duplicate between an
  # `UnstakedMultiple` event and its corresponding set of `Unstaked` events.
  # (2) The positions unstaked in an `UnstakedMultiple` event can be of different types (e.g. FIDU
  # and Curve LP), so their respective amounts are not necessarily commensurable, so summing
  # them to a total amount would be inappropriate. Our `Transaction` schema currently supports
  # only a single `amount` value for the transaction, so it "wants" us to do such summing. But we
  # cannot.
